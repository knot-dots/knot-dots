# Organization Menu UX Audit: User Flow Analysis and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

The knot-dots organization menu system implements a sophisticated multi-tenant architecture with hostname-based routing and hierarchical organizational units. However, critical UX issues severely impact usability, particularly **complete mobile inaccessibility** and **overwhelming information density** that creates significant cognitive load for users.

**Critical Finding**: The organization menu is entirely hidden on mobile devices (40rem breakpoint), making it impossible for mobile users to switch between organizations or organizational units.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Technical Implementation
- **Hostname-based routing**: `{org-guid}.base-url.com` pattern for multi-tenancy
- **Four-level hierarchy**: Organizations → Organizational Units (Levels 1-4)
- **Board layout**: 5-column interface (1 org column + 4 unit levels)
- **Component structure**: OrganizationMenu → OrganizationMenuCard → OrganizationCard → Card

### User Flow Mapping
```
1. User clicks organization button (desktop only)
   ↓
2. Full-screen panel opens with 5-column board
   ↓
3. User can:
   - Click organization card → redirects to {guid}.hostname
   - Click organizational unit card → redirects to {guid}.hostname  
   - Click "All Organizations" → redirects to base hostname
   - Use relation filter within panel (selectedContext binding)
   ↓
4. Panel closes, page reloads with new organizational context
```

## Critical UX Issues

### 1. **Mobile Accessibility Crisis**
**Issue**: Organization menu completely hidden on mobile devices
- CSS: `display: none` until `@container (min-width: 40rem)`
- **Impact**: ~50% of users cannot switch organizational contexts
- **Severity**: Critical - breaks core functionality

**Evidence**:
```css
.organization-menu {
    display: none;
    max-width: 20rem;
}

@container (min-width: 40rem) {
    .organization-menu {
        display: revert;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Overwhelming Information Architecture**
**Issue**: 5-column full-screen layout creates cognitive overload
- All organizations and 4 organizational unit levels displayed simultaneously
- Panel height: `calc(100vh - var(--header-height))` - takes entire viewport
- **Impact**: Users struggle to understand hierarchy and make decisions
- **Severity**: High - significantly impacts usability

### 3. **Confusing Dual Context System**
**Issue**: `currentContext` vs `selectedContext` creates mental model confusion
- Current context: actual loaded organization (from hostname)
- Selected context: filter state within dropdown panel
- Users don't understand the relationship between these states
- **Impact**: Unexpected behavior when filtering vs navigating
- **Severity**: High - breaks user expectations

### 4. **No Hierarchical Context Awareness**
**Issue**: Users lose track of their position in organizational hierarchy
- No breadcrumbs or path indicators
- All organizational unit levels look identical
- No visual connection between related units
- **Impact**: Users get lost in complex organizational structures
- **Severity**: Medium-High - impacts navigation efficiency

### 5. **Inaccessible Navigation Patterns**
**Issue**: Complex keyboard and screen reader navigation
- Board layout creates complex tab order
- No clear focus management
- Icon-only button with visually hidden text
- **Impact**: Inaccessible to users with disabilities
- **Severity**: High - accessibility compliance issue

## Detailed User Journey Analysis

### Scenario 1: Mobile User Trying to Switch Organizations
```
Current Flow:
1. User on mobile opens knot-dots
2. Sees content for Organization A
3. Needs to switch to Organization B
4. Looks for organization switcher → NOT FOUND
5. Stuck in Organization A context
```
**Outcome**: Task failure, user frustration

### Scenario 2: Desktop User Navigating Complex Hierarchy
```
Current Flow:
1. User clicks organization button
2. Presented with 5-column full-screen interface
3. Attempts to understand organizational structure
4. Clicks random organizational unit
5. Gets redirected to new subdomain
6. Confused about current location and how to get back
```
**Outcome**: Disorientation, inefficient navigation

### Scenario 3: New User Discovering Organization Features
```
Current Flow:
1. New user sees small organization icon in header
2. Icon provides no affordance about functionality
3. If clicked, overwhelming board interface appears
4. No onboarding or explanation of system
5. User closes panel without understanding value
```
**Outcome**: Feature abandonment, missed functionality

## Technical Architecture Issues

### Hostname-based Routing Complexity
```typescript
// From +layout.server.ts
if (url.hostname === new URL(env.PUBLIC_BASE_URL ?? '').hostname) {
    currentOrganization = organizations.find(({ payload }) => payload.default);
} else {
    currentOrganization = organizations.find(({ guid }) => url.hostname.startsWith(`${guid}.`));
}
```

**Problems**:
- Users don't understand connection between URL and context
- URL pattern transformations are invisible
- Complex debugging for development/support

### Performance Bottlenecks
```typescript
// Expensive filtering operations on every render
let organizationalUnitsByLevel = $derived.by(() => {
    let organizationalUnits = page.data.organizationalUnits.filter(/*complex logic*/);
    // ... more expensive operations
});
```

**Impact**: Slow render times, especially with large organizational structures

## UX Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)

#### 1. **Mobile Organization Switcher**
**Solution**: Implement mobile-specific organization picker

```svelte
<!-- Mobile-first approach -->
<div class="organization-selector">
    <!-- Mobile: Dropdown select -->
    <select class="mobile-org-picker">
        <option>Current Organization</option>
        <option>Other Organizations...</option>
    </select>
    
    <!-- Desktop: Enhanced current interface -->
    <button class="desktop-org-button">...</button>
</div>
```

**Benefits**: Restores functionality for mobile users, maintains desktop experience

#### 2. **Simplified Information Architecture**
**Solution**: Progressive disclosure with max 3 columns

```
Column 1: Organizations
Column 2: Current Org Units (if any)  
Column 3: Sub-units of selected (if any)
```

**Benefits**: Reduces cognitive load, clearer navigation path

#### 3. **Clear Context Indicators**
**Solution**: Add breadcrumb navigation and current context highlighting

```svelte
<div class="context-breadcrumb">
    <span>All Orgs</span> → 
    <span class="current">Organization Name</span> → 
    <span>Unit Level 2</span>
</div>
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX (Medium-term)

#### 4. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**
- Use distinct visual styling for each organizational level
- Implement indentation/nesting for sub-units
- Add icons or color coding for different levels

#### 5. **Better Onboarding**
- Add contextual help explaining organizational structure
- Implement guided tour for new users
- Provide tooltips explaining functionality

#### 6. **Enhanced Accessibility**
- Implement proper ARIA labels and role definitions
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Improve tab order and focus management

### Phase 3: Architectural Improvements (Long-term)

#### 7. **State Management Refactoring**
```typescript
// Centralized organization state
export const organizationStore = writable({
    current: null,
    available: [],
    hierarchy: {},
    navigationHistory: []
});
```

#### 8. **Performance Optimization**
- Lazy load organizational units by level
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Cache filtered results and hierarchy calculations

#### 9. **Enhanced Navigation Patterns**
- Add "Recent Organizations" for quick switching
- Implement search/filter within organization picker
- Add favorites/bookmarking for frequently accessed units
